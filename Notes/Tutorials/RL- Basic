At each step t the agent:
- Executes action at
- Receives observation ot
- Receives scalar reward rt

The environment:
- Receives action at
- Emits observation ot+1
- Emits scalar reward rt+1

I Experience is a sequence of observations, actions, rewards
o1, r1, a1, at−1, ot, rt
I The state is a summary of experience
st = f (o1,r1, a1, ..., at−1, ot ,rt)
I In a fully observed environment
st = f (ot)
